    <p>It is essentially a chat user interface to talk to language models.</p>
    <p>By providing language models more context in the form of descriptive system prompts, responses can be made much more relevant. Management and application of Personas is provided to this end.</p>
    <p>By chaining requests to language models and tools, complex flows of information and workflows can be built. Management and application of Teams is provided to this end.</p>
    <p>This software provides many of the features of Langchain, the dominant solution for chained workflows with language models.</p>
    <p>The software supports tool use and comes with tools for web search and code execution. The injection of recent hard data into the messages we send to language models significantly improves their truthfulness.</p>
    <p>The software includes a File Manager that generates vector embeddings to be used with an integrated Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) system.</p>
    <p>The software provides for multiple data sources to be injected into prompt workflows including.</p>
